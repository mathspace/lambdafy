# name is used for AWS resources and to uniquely identify the app
# Using the same name in the same AWS account and region will result in
# conflict and overwriting behavior.
# If your app has different stages (e.g. staging,production), create two
# spec files with different names (e.g. my-great-app-staging,
# my-great-app-production). Essentially, treat each stage as a separate
# app. Same for environments or variations of your app.
name: my-great-app

# public: false by default.
#   if set to true:  will allow unauthenticated access to the app. 
#   if set to false: will redirect to SSO before allowing access.
public: true

# env defines the environmental variables available to the app. The
# values follow the format for https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oxplot/starenv
# In short:
# - Values starting with asterisk (*) are treated especially
# - Special token "@@LAMBDAFY_PORT@@" is replaced with the port that the
#   application is expected to be listening on. This is the same value as
#   available in PORT env var as set by the proxy.
# - All other values are treated as literals.
env:
  FOO: "bar"
  ABC: "123"
  LISTEN_ADDR: "0.0.0.0:@@LAMBDAFY_PORT@@"
  API_KEY: "*ssm:arn:aws:ssm:us-west-2:1234567:parameter/lambdafy/my-great-app/key"

# entrypoint is analogous to Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT directive. Specifying
# it will override the existing ENTRYPOINT in the docker image.
# NOTE: @@LAMBDAFY_PORT@@ is replaced in entrypoint and command as well.
#
# entrypoint:
#   - /bin/sh
#   - -c

# command is analogous to Dockerfile CMD directive. Specifying it will
# override the existing CMD in the docker image.
#
# command:
#  - /my-great-app $FOO --key=$API_KEY

# role is the name of a IAM role, required if your docker image needs
# access to AWS resources other than those provided by lambdafy by
# default.

# role: "arn:..."

# memory specifies the amount of RAM available to lambda function in
# MBs. Defatuls to 128 and can be up to 10240 in 1 increments.
#
# memory: 512

# timeout specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds the lambda
# function is allowed to run. Defaults to 3 and can be up to 900 in 1
# second increments.
#
# timeout: 30

# allowed_account_regions is a list of account:region that specify which
# AWS account and region combinations are allowed to be deployed to.
# This ensures accidental overwrites do not happen. Wildcards can be
# used for both account and region parts.
# If unspecified, all regions and all accounts are allowed.
#
# allowed_account_regions:
#   - "*:us-*"  # any account and us regions
#   - "123456789:ap-southeast-2"  # specific region of specific account

# reserved_concurrency is the number of concurrent executions of the
# function that is guaranteed.
#
# reserved_concurrency: 5
