*lambdafy* makes it easy to deploy **any** docker image verbatim on AWS Lambda
that serves a website.

This frees you from the constraints of available AWS Lambda runtimes.

## Get Started

Download [the latest release
binary](https://github.com/mathspace/lambdafy/releases) for your
OS/architecture, extract it and put it in your path.

Create an example project in `mynewlambda` directory and follow its `Readme.md`.

```sh
lambdafy create-sample-project mynewlambda
```

## What's next?

*lambdafy* command has completely self contained help. Run each command with
`-h` to see the available subcommands. There are dedicated guide commands as
well.
